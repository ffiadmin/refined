Grove City College Student Government Association Refined Theme
===

Refined extends the simplicity, minimalist design, and beauty of the modern web to the Wordpress platform. It features a responsive design designed to work equally as well on the desktop as it does on tablets and mobile phones. It is packaged with the ability to log a user in with a custom interface, while additionally providing a complete and simplified user registration interface, all without forcing the user to leave the familiar look and feel of the website.
